# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm In Young (my first name comes in two words!)

ðŸŽ“ Former political economy researcher  
ðŸ”§ Now working at the intersection of **machine learning**, **environmental sensing**, and **sustainable materials innovation**  
ðŸŒŽ Focused on climate resilience and justice-driven technologies

My work has always been guided by a core question:  
**Why are some communities systematically worse offâ€”and what can we do about it?**

I began by studying this through the lens of international political economy, using game theory and statistical modeling to explore how winners and losers are created through global policymaking. Over time, my focus shifted toward the *material consequences* of inequalityâ€”pollution, neglected infrastructure, and visible waste. These patterns werenâ€™t abstract; they reflected my own lived experience growing up in South Korea, and what I saw echoed in communities affected by environmental neglect.

As climate change emerged as a global crisis, I began connecting the dots between systemic injustice and environmental harm. That shift led me to focus on **climate resilience**, where I now apply data science, machine learning, and materials engineering to build tools that reduce pollution and improve conditions in underserved communities.
