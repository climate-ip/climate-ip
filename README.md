# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm In Young (my first name comes in two words!)

I'm a political economy researcher turned engineer, currently pivoting into applied machine learning for environmental sensing and materials innovation.

My work has been driven by one core question: **Why are some communities systematically worse offâ€”and how can we change that?** I first approached this problem through the lens of international political economy, using tools like game theory and statistical modeling to understand how winners and losers are created and sustained through global policymaking.

As my research deepened, I became more attuned to how environmental conditionsâ€”like neglected infrastructure, pollution, and visible wasteâ€”mirror and reinforce social and economic disparities. These werenâ€™t abstract patterns; they echoed what I had experienced growing up, and what I saw reflected in communities most affected by environmental neglect.

Around the same time, climate change was becoming a more urgent and widely recognized global issue. That shift helped me connect the dots between systemic inequality and environmental harm.

I began focusing on the environmental dimensions of injustice, especially where they intersect with climate risk and unequal access to resilience. Now, Iâ€™m exploring how data science, machine learning, and sustainable materials innovation can be used to create solutions that reduce pollution and support climate resilience in underserved communities.

- **RADAR** â€“ A natural language processing pipeline to detect urgent animal rescue signals from social media posts (text classification, sentiment, and urgency detection)
- **Trash Traceback Engine** â€“ A computer vision and geospatial ML project to identify marine pollution hotspots and trace their likely upstream sources using satellite imagery and clustering techniques

ðŸ“˜ Portfolio projects coming soonâ€”follow along as I build!
