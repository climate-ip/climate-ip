# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm In Young 
*(my first name comes in two words!)*

ðŸŒŽ Building tech for climate resilience and justice  
ðŸŽ“ Former political economy researcher  
ðŸ”§ Now working at the intersection of **machine learning**, **environmental sensing**, and **sustainable materials innovation**

### ðŸ’¡ **What Drives Me**

My work is grounded in a single question:  
**How do deeply entrenched systems of inequality actually change?**  

Not just why some communities remain worse off â€”  
but how, at certain moments, norms break, laws shift, and long-accepted injustices become unthinkable.

### ðŸ“š **Where I Started**

I spent years unpacking that question by modeling how global trade and domestic policy decisions create winners and losers.  

As the climate crisis gained more visibility, my focus shifted â€”  
from high-level models to the **visible, material fallout**: in particular, the intersection of economic inequality, environmental pollution, and gendered health outcomes. 

- Womenâ€™s fertility issues linked to toxic exposures in built environments  
- Waste piling up in marginalized neighborhoods  
- The global trash trade funneling landfill into poorer countries

### ðŸ”¨ **What Iâ€™m Building Now**

Iâ€™m building tools for **climate resilience** â€”  
applying **data science**, **machine learning**, and **materials engineering** to reduce pollution and restore dignity in the places that have long been left behind, and help **actively bring about the very change I once studied from a distance**.

### ðŸ”¬ **Currently Building**

- **RADAR**: NLP system for surfacing animal abuse reports and early ecological distress from social media posts  
- **Trash Traceback Engine**: Computer vision & geospatial ML for identifying marine pollution hotspots and tracing upstream sources
