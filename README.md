# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm In Young (my first name comes in two words!)

ðŸŒŽ Building tech for climate resilience and justice  
ðŸŽ“ Former political economy researcher  
ðŸ”§ Now working at the intersection of **machine learning**, **environmental sensing**, and **sustainable materials innovation**

My work is grounded in a single question:  
**How do deeply entrenched systems of inequality actually change?**  
Not just why some communities remain worse offâ€”but how, at certain moments, norms break, laws shift, and long-accepted injustices become unthinkable.

* I spent years unpacking that question by modeling how global trade and domestic policy decisions create winners and losers.  
* As the climate crisis gained more visibility, my focus shifted from high-level models to the visible, material fallout: in particular, the intersection of economic inequality, environmental pollution, and gendered health outcomes. Womenâ€™s fertility issues linked to toxic exposures in built environments. Waste piling up in marginalized neighborhoods. The global trash trade funneling landfill into poorer countries.  
* Now, Iâ€™m building tools for climate resilienceâ€”applying data science, machine learning, and materials engineering to reduce pollution and restore dignity in the places that have long been left behind.
